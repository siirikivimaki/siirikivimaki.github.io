Welcome to my academic website. I am a mathematician working in the field of set theory. 

Currently I am doing my PhD as a cotutelle agreement between Université Paris Cité and University of Helsinki, under the supervision of Juliette Kennedy, Jouko Väänänen and Boban Veličković. My research interests in set theory include forcing and combinatorics of uncountable objects, universality problems and model theory of infinitary logics. 

See my research <a href="https://siirikivimaki.github.io/research">here</a>. For more, see my <a href="assets/pdfs/researchstatement.pdf" target="_blank">research statement</a> or <a href="assets/pdfs/cv.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
